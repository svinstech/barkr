## Barkr: A Modern Lifestyle Brand for Dogs

Welcome to Barkr, a dog-centered lifestyle brand building a whole new way
of interacting with the great outdoors. We're interested in helping dogs
find safe places to camp, away from pesky coyotes.

We have provided some data about coyotes. Your goal is simply to ingest this
data, apply some rules, and transform it so that it can be read by our
proprietary blockchain-powered AI neural network that accepts only JSON data.

The only required installation for this package is `pytest`. You should unzip
`data.zip`, but you shouldn't have to look into `data.csv`. You'll edit only
`exercise.py`, and won't need any imports other than what's already there. The
other files are all set as is. Feel free to examine those other files and to
look up any relevant libraries or functions you need.
